### Getting Started with OS X

Welcome to this quick start guide to setting up OS X for development.

### User Accounts

I like to have two user accounts on my Mac -- one for myself as a standard user and one for an administrator.
When you first power on your Mac, you create an initial user account, say `robert`.
That account is setup as an administrator.  Let's change that.

1. Login as `robert` and bring up the system preferences for Users & Groups.
2. Add a new user.  Select New Account: `Administration` with an Account Name: `admin`.
3. Logout and then login as `admin`.
4. Select the user `robert` and uncheck the box *Allow user to administer this computer*.

The rest of this guide will be done as the standard user and will specifically mention
when things need to be done as the administrator.
